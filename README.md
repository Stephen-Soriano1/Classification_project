# Classification_project

This is my first version of the classification
in this project i will go over the telco dataset that i got from codeup severs or you can get it from kaggle.
 
 My Goal for this project was to determined to why people were churming. 
 	what is the problem im trying to solve- the plan is to find Why are customers churning
	what is the end goal - to answer the 4 question on why people are churning  
The four question i will answer inside the project 
Are customers with DSL more or less likely to churn?

What month are customers most likely to churn and does that depend on their contract type?

Is there a service that is associated with more churn than expected?

Do customers who churn have a higher average monthly spend than those who don't?


ACQUIRE
	what data do i need to solve the problem- i need to use stat test on two of the question to find my finding 

	where are you getting your data from? - im am getting this data from codeup mysql sever, you would need a login and a password to be able to get it 

	what does that the data mean?




PREPARE / PREPROCCES
	solve for NA
	solve for unnecessary columns
	split into train, validate, test
	any features needed to change for models
	clean data (check data types, address wrong data)
	encode the proper columns()



EXPLORE
	identify key variables
	any correlations
	create hypothesis questions
	statistics test
	study what you think might be important




MODEL
	only use encoded
	create baseline
	choose the model
	use more than 1 model
	evaluate on train and validate
	DON'T USE TEST UNLESS FINAL DECISION





DELIVER
	section of time to rehearse
	identify how delivery will be (powerpoint, notebook, excel etc...)
